            "- **Strong Generalization:** Maintained good performance on a completely external dataset (Z-Alizadeh Sani) with a different structure.\n",
            "- **High Recall (Sensitivity):** **0.7130**. The primary screening goal (finding patients) was successfully met.\n",
            "- **High Precision (Positive Predictive Value):** **0.8280**. When the model predicts a case is 'Cardio', it is correct ~83% of the time (reducing false alarms compared to an unconstrained model).\n",
            "- **Improved Balance:** Macro F1-Score increased to **0.6527**.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. Weaknesses and Limitations Required for Documentation (for Article/Report)\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Weak Precision in Predicting Healthy Cases (Healthy PPV):**\n",
            "   - Value: **~0.47** (derived from External Validation's Precision for Class 0).\n",
            "   - **Interpretation:** Approximately half of the individuals the model predicts as 'Healthy' are actually patients (relatively high False Negatives on the healthy side). This suggests the model may lack sufficient specificity for use in **low-risk general populations** and might miss true cases. This must be contrasted with the high Precision of the disease class.\n",
            "- **Dataset Structural Differences (Dataset Shift/Bias):**\n",
            "   - The external set (Z-Alizadeh Sani), despite confirming generalizability, has significant structural and statistical differences from the main set (e.g., focus on Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) vs. general 'Cardio').\n",
            "   - **Recommendation:** It should be stated in the documentation that these differences serve as a **limitation to the model's generalization** and that the model may require re-calibration in clinical populations with substantially different feature distributions.\n",
            "- **Overall Accuracy (~0.69):**\n",
            "   - While acceptable for highly balanced models optimized for Recall, overall accuracy is modest. It is a trade-off for the high sensitivity, as increasing general accuracy might compromise the crucial high Recall score.\n",
